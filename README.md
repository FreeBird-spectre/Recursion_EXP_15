# 🚀 C++ Recursion Practice Programs

## 🎯 Aim
To understand and implement basic recursion in C++ through simple programs that calculate factorials, reverse strings, and find the sum of natural numbers.

## 🧰 Apparatus
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C++)
- IDE or Text Editor (e.g., VS Code, Dev C++)
- Terminal or Online Compiler

## 📚 Theory

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It is useful for tasks that can be broken down into similar subtasks, such as mathematical calculations and string processing.

### 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Base Case**: The condition that stops recursion.
- **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller input.
- **Stack Memory**: Each recursive call is stored in memory until the base case is reached.

## 🧮 Programs and Algorithms

### 1️⃣ Factorial Program – Using Recursion

**Description**: Calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.

**Algorithm**:
- If the number is 0, return 1.
- Otherwise, return number × factorial of (number - 1).

**Output**:

Enter a positive integer: 7

Factorial of 7 is: 5040

### 2️⃣ String Reversal – Using Recursion

**Description**: Reverses a string entered by the user using recursion.

**Algorithm**:
- Find the length of the string.
- Recursively print characters from the end to the beginning.

**Output**:

Enter a string: Spiderman

Reversed string: namredipS

### 3️⃣ Sum of Natural Numbers – Using Recursion

**Description**: Calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to the entered number.

**Algorithm**:
- If the number is 1 or less, return the number.
- Otherwise, return number + sum of (number - 1).

**Output**:

Enter a number: 78

Sum is: 3081
